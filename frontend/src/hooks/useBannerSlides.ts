/**
 * Loads the admin-managed banner slideshow for a position (any string -
 * "home", "subpage", a fixed page's own `kind`, or a Seiten page's slug;
 * see Admin > Werbebanner / Banner.tsx), falling back to `fallbackSlides`
 * (the site's original curated set) whenever no admin rows exist for that
 * position (or its optional `fallbackPosition`, tried next) or none of
 * their image URLs actually load.
 *
 * Every candidate URL is preloaded via a real Image() first, same as
 * usePageGallery/useValidatedImageList - Banner.tsx previously fetched this
 * same data with no validation, which meant a single stale/deleted upload
 * silently broke the whole slideshow the moment the fetch resolved. The
 * fix here goes one step further than those hooks: since the caller
 * doesn't just render a static grid but is actively mid-animation by the
 * time this resolves, returning a brand new array reference (as this hook
 * unavoidably does, fallback -> admin-configured) needs the caller to also
 * reset its own slide-index state when the array identity changes -
 * otherwise the old numeric slide index still points into the new array at
 * the wrong photo, or past the end of it. See Banner.tsx's `slides` effect.
 * `text` is only ever populated when `withCaptions` is true (the "home"
 * position) - every other position never shows a caption box, no matter
 * what's typed into its "Titel" field in the admin, matching the old site.
